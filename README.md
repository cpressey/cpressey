Most of the things I make, I make under the auspices of [Cat's Eye Technologies](https://catseye.tc/),
so if you're looking for things I've made, you probably want to look at
**[@catseye](https://github.com/orgs/catseye/)** instead.

Interests: **programming languages** ([esolangs](http://esolangs.org/), effect systems, flow typing, ...),
**aesthetics** (composition, art history, [generative art](https://github.com/topics/gewgaw), ...),
**video games** (design, mechanics, as reactive systems, as techno-aesthetic objects...), **logic** (theorem proving, ...),
**algebraic properties** of all of the above

Languages I program in a lot: Python, Haskell, JavaScript  
Languages I sometimes program in: Lua, Scheme, ANSI C  
Languages I don't plan to program in: Clojure, Rust
