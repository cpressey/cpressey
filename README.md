Hi there, I'm Chris Pressey.  Most of the things I make, I make under the auspices of [Cat's Eye Technologies](https://catseye.tc/),
so if you're looking for things I've made, you probably want to look at
**[https://codeberg.org/catseye](https://codeberg.org/catseye/)** instead.

_When Microsoft acquired GitHub, I didn't leave immediately.  I wanted to give them a chance.  Well, they had their chance._

_It's not that I've suddenly become a Free Software zealot. But I do think open source should be more than just something that enables a **"Community Tier (FREE!)"** business model._

_There is also a significant amount of irony in a code host based on an open-source distributed version control system becoming "too big to fail",_
_and actually, when I say "significant", what I mean is "insupportable".  So, I can no longer in good conscience support it._

ยน As far as is humanly possible.  Actually, insofar as what I've done has been open sourced I can't actually prevent anyone from
uploading it here, "stopping using GitHub" for me consists in (a) not visiting the site if I don't have a very good reason to, (b) not hyperlinking
to content on GitHub if there is any other option, and (c) promoting viable alternatives, such as [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/).
