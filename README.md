Most of the things I make, I make under the auspices of [Cat's Eye Technologies](https://catseye.tc/),
so if you're looking for things I've made, you probably want to look at
**[@catseye](https://github.com/orgs/catseye/)** instead.

Interests:
*   **programming languages** ([esolangs](http://esolangs.org/), formal semantics, static analysis, ...),
*   **computation** (computability/complexity theory, automata/formal languages...),
*   **aesthetics** (techno-aesthetics, curation/retrocomputing, [generative art](https://github.com/topics/gewgaw), [NaNoGenMo](https://github.com/catseye/NaNoGenMo-Entries-2019/)...),
*   **video games** ([as reactive systems](https://github.com/catseye/Nested-Modal-Transducers), as techno-aesthetic objects...),
*   **logic** (proof systems, logical calculi, theorem proving...)

Currently working on: modernizing the [Burro](https://github.com/catseye/Burro) distribution and fixing its Turing-completeness proof.  
Currently learning: [Coq](https://softwarefoundations.cis.upenn.edu/).
