Most of the things I make, I make under the auspices of [Cat's Eye Technologies](https://catseye.tc/),
so if you're looking for things I've made, you probably want to look at
**[@catseye](https://github.com/orgs/catseye/)** instead.

Interests: **programming languages** ([esolangs](http://esolangs.org/), effect systems, flow typing, ...),
**computation** (computability/complexity theory, automata/formal languages, retrocomputing...),
**aesthetics** (composition, art history, [generative art](https://github.com/topics/gewgaw), [NaNoGenMo](https://github.com/catseye/NaNoGenMo-Entries-2019/)...),
**video games** ([as reactive systems](https://github.com/catseye/Nested-Modal-Transducers), as techno-aesthetic objects...),
**logic** (proof systems, theorem proving, ...),
**algebraic properties** of all of the above

Currently working on: modernizing the [Burro](https://github.com/catseye/Burro) distribution (10 year anniversary!) and fixing its Turing-completeness proof.
Currently learning: [Coq](https://softwarefoundations.cis.upenn.edu/).
