Hi there, I'm Chris Pressey.  Most of the things I make, I make under the auspices of [Cat's Eye Technologies](https://catseye.tc/),
so if you're looking for things I've made, you probably want to look at
**[catseye @ Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/catseye/)** instead.

_It's not that I've suddenly become a Free Software zealot. But I do think open source should be more than just something that enables a **"Community Tier (FREE!)"** business model._

_When Microsoft acquired GitHub, I didn't leave immediately.  I wanted to give them a chance._

_Well, they've had their chance.  They squandered it._

_Enjoy your rat race, folks._
