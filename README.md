Hi there, I'm Chris Pressey.  Most of the things I make, I make under the auspices of [Cat's Eye Technologies](https://catseye.tc/),
so if you're looking for things I've made, you probably want to look at
**[@catseye](https://github.com/orgs/catseye/)** instead.

<details>
  <summary>My story is...</summary>
  
*   In 1993 I designed [Befunge](https://github.com/catseye/Befunge-93/) and released it (on my BBS, running on an Amiga 500, in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada).
*   In the late 90's I designed a few more unusual programming languages, and ran a web page and a mailing list about "esoteric topics in programming languages", from which  [esolang](https://esolangs.org/) got its name.
*   In the 00's I went back to university and completed my BSc in computer science.  And I designed a few more unusual programming languages.
*   In the 10's I undertook some independent study in art, in part to try to answer the question: are esolangs art?  And I designed a few more unusual programming languages.

<details>
  <summary>My interests include...</summary>
  
*   **programming languages** ([esolangs](http://esolangs.org/), formal semantics, static analysis, ...),
*   **computation** (computability/complexity theory, automata/formal languages...),
*   **aesthetics** (techno-aesthetics, curation/retrocomputing, [generative art](https://github.com/topics/gewgaw), [NaNoGenMo](https://github.com/catseye/NaNoGenMo-Entries-2019/)...),
*   **video games** ([as reactive systems](https://github.com/catseye/Nested-Modal-Transducers), as techno-aesthetic objects...),
*   **logic** (proof systems, logical calculi, theorem proving...).

<details>
  <summary>Currently I'm working on...</summary>
  
*   modernizing the [Burro](https://github.com/catseye/Burro) distribution and fixing its Turing-completeness proof.

<details>
  <summary>Currently I'm trying to learn...</summary>
  
*   [Coq](https://softwarefoundations.cis.upenn.edu/).

  <summary>The most important thing you should know about software engineering is...</summary>
  
**You need to have a specification.**

  <details>
    <summary>And the reason I say that is...</summary>

There's this idea floating around out there that the code itself is definitive â€” that you need nothing other than the code.

But the code itself can only tell you **what it actually does**, not **what it is supposed to do**.

Given some uncommented code, **you can only make educated guesses about what it's supposed to do.**

If you treat the code itself as definitive, then **by definition, it has no bugs** â€”
because to say that it has a bug is to say that it's wrong, and on what basis can you say that it's wrong,
if it's definitive?

Clearly, code **can** have bugs â€” we all know this.  Therefore code cannot act as its own specification.
Therefore **you need to have a specification**, of some sort.

Now, there are many ways to make a specification.  Automated tests aren't a perfect way to make a specification, but 
**having automated tests is much better than not having any specification at all**,
and in most development teams they will give the most "bang for your buck".
