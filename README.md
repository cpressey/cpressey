#### Quotes about Programming Language

"First, we want to establish the idea that a computer language is not just a way of getting a computer to perform operations but rather that it is a novel formal medium for expressing ideas about methodology. Thus, programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute."  
― Abelson and Sussman

"A language that doesn't affect the way you think about programming, is not worth knowing."  
― Alan Perlis

"The most important thing in the programming language is the name. A language will not succeed without a good name. I have recently invented a very good name and now I am looking for a suitable language."  
― Donald Knuth

#### Quotes about Engineering

"If you do not experiment first, your whole product will be an experiment."  
― apocryphal (from the Erlang community)

"The only thing worse than generalizing from a single example is generalizing from no examples at all."  
― apocryphal (from the FreeBSD community)

"Premature optimization is the root of all evil."  
― Donald Knuth

"We must not forget that the wheel is reinvented so often because it is a very good idea; I've learned to worry more about the soundness of ideas that were invented only once."  
― David Parnas

"Programmers are not to be measured by their ingenuity and their logic but by the completeness of their case analysis."  
― Alan Perlis

#### Quotes about Troubleshooting

"Only turn one knob at a time."  
― apocryphal
