Most of the things I make, I make under the auspices of [Cat's Eye Technologies](https://catseye.tc/),
so if you're looking for things I've made, you probably want to look at
**[@catseye](https://github.com/orgs/catseye/)** instead.

Interests:
*   **programming languages** ([esolangs](http://esolangs.org/), effect systems, abstract interpretation, ...)
*   **art** (conceptual art, [generative art](https://github.com/topics/gewgaw), techno-aesthetics, ...)
*   **video game design** (retrogames, ...)
*   **logic** (theorem proving, ...)
*   **algebraic structures** in all of the above
