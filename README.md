Hi there, I'm Chris Pressey.  Most of the things I make, I make under the auspices of [Cat's Eye Technologies](https://catseye.tc/),
so if you're looking for things I've made, you probably want to look at
**[@catseye](https://github.com/orgs/catseye/)** instead.

**You need to have a specification.**

There is a certain school of thought out there that the code itself is definitive â€” that you need nothing other than the code.

But the code itself can only tell you **what it actually does**, not **what it is supposed to do**.

Given some uncommented code, **you can only make educated guesses about what it's supposed to do.**

If you treat the code itself as definitive, then **by definition, it has no bugs** â€”
because to say that it has a bug is to say that it's wrong, and on what basis can you say that it's wrong,
if it's definitive?

Clearly, code **can** have bugs â€” we all know this.  Therefore code cannot act as its own specification.
Therefore **you need to have a specification**, of some sort.

Now, there are many ways to make a specification.  Automated tests aren't a perfect way to make a specification, but 
**having automated tests is much better than not having any specification at all**,
and in most development teams they will give the most "bang for your buck".
